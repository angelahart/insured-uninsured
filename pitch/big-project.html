  <h3>Big Project</h3>
  <h2>Understanding Where California's Uninsured Live</h2>

  <p>Pitch: It is estimated that 2.4 million Californians will gain health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act, through expanded Medi-Cal, or the state health insurance marketplace. But health experts say the population who will remain ineligible for health insurance even after Jan. 1 is nearly double that. Up to 4 million people will live in the Golden State without access to affordable, quality health care, and three-quarters of those left out of health reform will not be able to get covered because of their immigration status.


	<h3>News Angle</h3>
	<p>The Affordable Care Act goes into effect Jan. 1. Meanwhile, the president is pushing what arguably is his second biggest policy agenda — immigration reform. This map will look at the intersection of the two in California.</p>

	<h3>Background</h3>

	<p>California is leading the way in health care reform. It was the first to launch its state exchange, and many safety-net programs — the Low Income Health Program, for example — are already in place that automatically are moving millions of Californians to Medi-Cal, which on Jan. 1 will for the first time cover single adults without children. However, the severely poor, those who are incarcerated, Naive Americans, and undocumented immigrants are not eligible for new state or federal programs that provide health insurance to some of the most needy populations.</p>

	<p>How do you track an invisible population?</p>
	<p>Where do most of California's uninsured live?</p>
	<p>Can I compare counties and understand how many people will be eligible for insurance, and how many will be left out></p>
